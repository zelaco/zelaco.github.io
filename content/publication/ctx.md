abstract: Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins are a great
  concern for public health, as these are first-line drugs to treat infections. The
  production of carbapenemases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or
  the overexpression of AmpC β-lactamases are the main mechanisms of resistance to
  these antibiotics. Among the ESBLs, CTX-M β-lactamases are the most prevalent worldwide.
  Our aims were to determine the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
  along a heavily polluted river and characterize blaCTX-M carriers. River water was
  collected in 11 sites along the main course and tributaries, in two sampling moments.
  Water quality was evaluated and a collection of cefotaxime-resistant isolates was
  obtained. blaCTX-M carriers were characterized regarding phylogenetic affiliation,
  clonality, antibiotic susceptibility, gene diversity, and context. Water presented
  very low quality in all sites. From 147 cefotaxime-resistant isolates, 46% carried
  blaCTX-M and were affiliated with Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter.
  Molecular typing revealed clonal isolates in different sites and over the two years,
  suggesting survival of the strains in the river or continuous pollution inputs from
  the same sources. Eight variants of blaCTX-M were found, with blaCTX-M-15 being
  the most prevalent (52.5%). Sites with a lower water quality showed the highest
  resistance rates and prevalence of blaCTX-M, suggesting that river water may embody
  human health risks.
