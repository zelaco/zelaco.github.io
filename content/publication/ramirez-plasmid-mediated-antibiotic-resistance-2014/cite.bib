 abstract = {Plasmids harbor genes coding for specific functions including virulence factors and antibiotic resistance that permit bacteria to survive the hostile environment found in the host and resist treatment. Together with other genetic elements such as integrons and transposons, and using a variety of mechanisms, plasmids participate in the dissemination of these traits, resulting in the virtual elimination of barriers among different kinds of bacteria. In this article we review the current information about the physiology of plasmids and their role in virulence and antibiotic resistance from the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium has acquired multidrug resistance and is the causative agent of serious community- and hospital-acquired infections. It is also included in the recently defined ESKAPE group of bacteria that cause most U.S. hospital infections.},
