abstract: Plasmids harbor genes coding for specific functions including virulence
  factors and antibiotic resistance that permit bacteria to survive the hostile environment
  found in the host and resist treatment. Together with other genetic elements such
  as integrons and transposons, and using a variety of mechanisms, plasmids participate
  in the dissemination of these traits, resulting in the virtual elimination of barriers
  among different kinds of bacteria. In this article we review the current information
  about the physiology of plasmids and their role in virulence and antibiotic resistance
  from the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium
  has acquired multidrug resistance and is the causative agent of serious community-
  and hospital-acquired infections. It is also included in the recently defined ESKAPE
  group of bacteria that cause most U.S. hospital infections.
