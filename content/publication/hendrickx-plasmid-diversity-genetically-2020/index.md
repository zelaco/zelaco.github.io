abstract: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae emerged as a nosocomial pathogen
  causing morbidity and mortality in patients. For infection prevention it is important
  to track the spread of K. pneumoniae and its plasmids between patients. Therefore,
  the major aim was to recapitulate the contents and diversity of the plasmids of
  genetically related K. pneumoniae strains harboring the beta-lactamase gene blaKPC-2
  or blaKPC-3 to determine their dissemination in the Netherlands and the former Dutch
  Caribbean islands from 2014 to 2019. Next-generation sequencing was combined with
  long-read third-generation sequencing to reconstruct 22 plasmids. wgMLST revealed
  five genetic clusters comprised of K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 isolates and four clusters
  consisted of blaKPC-3 isolates. KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 isolates were found both
  in the Netherlands and the Caribbean islands, while blaKPC-3 cluster isolates only
  in the Netherlands. Each K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 or blaKPC-3 cluster was characterized
  by a distinct resistome and plasmidome. However, the large and medium plasmids contained
  a variety of antibiotic resistance genes, conjugation machinery, cation transport
  systems, transposons, toxin/antitoxins, insertion sequences and prophage-related
  elements. The small plasmids carried genes implicated in virulence. Thus, implementing
  long-read plasmid sequencing analysis for K. pneumoniae surveillance provided important
  insights in the transmission of a KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 strain between the Netherlands
  and the Caribbean.
