	abstract = {Hospitals can carry high levels of bacterial diversity from all types of origins, such as human skin, outside environment and medical equipment. Sink drains in clinical settings are considered reservoirs for pathogenic bacteria and potential sources of hospital-acquired infections (HAI's) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Therefore, infection control measures are crucial to minimizing the risks associated with these reservoirs. Recent research has focused primarily on intensive care units (ICUs) and known pathogens, often employing metagenomic approaches that do not include bacterial isolation. This study aims to evaluate bacterial diversity using culturomics, extending the investigation beyond the ICU to identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria.A total of four samplings were conducted over one year (March 2022 to March 2023) in five different hospital wards (ICU, General Medicine (GM), Hematology (H), Short stay unit (UCE) and Microbiology laboratory (MS)). All samples were cultured on selective and non-selective culture media, resulting in 1058 isolates identified using MALDI-TOF MS, with a subset confirmed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Isolates retrieved from antibiotic supplemented agar were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing.The highest bacterial diversity, as measured by the Shannon index, was observed in the ICU and GM wards, posing significant risks to patients in these areas. While bacterial genera were largely similar across wards and sampling times, with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas being the most prevalent, different species were detected in each sampling, indicating no loss of diversity. This suggests that these environments undergo dynamic changes over time, influenced by their surroundings. The results also indicate a relationship between human activity and drain usage and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most commonly found species across most wards. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all tested isolates, except for one, were multi-resistant, including clinically relevant species, such as P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae.Hospital drains may serve as reservoirs for both known and emerging pathogens exhibiting high antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Their dynamic nature may provide insights into strategies for preventing the colonization of these environments by such species.},

	abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae emerged as a nosocomial pathogen causing morbidity and mortality in patients. For infection prevention it is important to track the spread of K. pneumoniae and its plasmids between patients. Therefore, the major aim was to recapitulate the contents and diversity of the plasmids of genetically related K. pneumoniae strains harboring the beta-lactamase gene blaKPC-2 or blaKPC-3 to determine their dissemination in the Netherlands and the former Dutch Caribbean islands from 2014 to 2019. Next-generation sequencing was combined with long-read third-generation sequencing to reconstruct 22 plasmids. wgMLST revealed five genetic clusters comprised of K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 isolates and four clusters consisted of blaKPC-3 isolates. KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 isolates were found both in the Netherlands and the Caribbean islands, while blaKPC-3 cluster isolates only in the Netherlands. Each K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 or blaKPC-3 cluster was characterized by a distinct resistome and plasmidome. However, the large and medium plasmids contained a variety of antibiotic resistance genes, conjugation machinery, cation transport systems, transposons, toxin/antitoxins, insertion sequences and prophage-related elements. The small plasmids carried genes implicated in virulence. Thus, implementing long-read plasmid sequencing analysis for K. pneumoniae surveillance provided important insights in the transmission of a KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 strain between the Netherlands and the Caribbean.},

	abstract = {Plasmids harbor genes coding for specific functions including virulence factors and antibiotic resistance that permit bacteria to survive the hostile environment found in the host and resist treatment. Together with other genetic elements such as integrons and transposons, and using a variety of mechanisms, plasmids participate in the dissemination of these traits, resulting in the virtual elimination of barriers among different kinds of bacteria. In this article we review the current information about the physiology of plasmids and their role in virulence and antibiotic resistance from the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium has acquired multidrug resistance and is the causative agent of serious community- and hospital-acquired infections. It is also included in the recently defined ESKAPE group of bacteria that cause most U.S. hospital infections.},
